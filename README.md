Phishing Traits Found in the Email
1.	Fake Email Address
•	The email says it’s from “Amazon Shop,” but the actual email address is do-not-reply@apponline.info.
•	Real Amazon emails come from addresses ending in @amazon.com, not some unknown website.
•	This is a clear sign it’s pretending to be Amazon.
2.	Header Warning
•	The email shows a warning like: “You are viewing an attached message.”
•	This means the email might have been changed or sent from an unknown or unsafe source.
•	Real emails from trusted companies usually don’t show this kind of warning.
3.	Suspicious Links and Buttons
•	The email includes buttons like “Sign up for Amazon Prime” and “Product Link.”
•	But these links could actually take you to fake websites that try to steal your login or credit card info.
•	We can’t see the real link in the image, but phishing emails often do this trick.
4.	Dangerous Attachment
•	The email looks like it contains another message inside (an attached message).
•	This is risky — it might have viruses or try to secretly install bad software on your device.
•	Legit companies rarely send emails with message attachments like this.
5.	Urgent and Tempting Language
•	It says things like “Sign up now” and “Deals are live!”
•	This creates pressure, making you act fast without thinking carefully.
•	Phishing emails use this trick to make you click links quickly.
6.	Link Text vs Real Link
•	The visible link might say “Amazon” or “Product Link,” but if you hover your mouse, it might go to a completely different and unsafe site.
•	This trick is used to fool people into clicking.
7.	Spelling and Grammar
•	The email doesn’t have many spelling or grammar mistakes, which make it look more trustworthy.
•	But even well-written emails can be fake.
